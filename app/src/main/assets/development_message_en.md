**[Minderf: A Journey to Find Your Emotional Coordinates]**

**"Where is your heart right now?"**
**Welcome to Minderf, where we help you find and care for your emotions.**

Hello.

I created this app to help answer those difficult questions: What exactly am I feeling? Where is my heart at this moment? It started from a desire to find small answers to these overwhelming questions.

I'm currently running this space alone. Due to budget and time constraints, I may not be able to implement all the wonderful features you suggest right away. However, I'm taking it step by step, without rushing. I'll gradually expand the server, refine the analysis tools, and ensure your precious records remain safe and secure.

Minderf is built with 'a parent's heart.' It carries the sincerity of parents who must quietly watch over their children as they experience both joyful and difficult days ahead. I hope this sincerity reaches you and that this app becomes a 'good app' that brings positive influence to our lives.

May your records here make your today a little clearer and warmer.

Thank you.

**P.S. I hope this app becomes a small guide for my precious wife and daughter.**
